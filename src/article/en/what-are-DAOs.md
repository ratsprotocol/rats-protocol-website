DAO stands for "Decentralized Autonomous Organization",and is an organizational form derived from the core concepts of blockchain. It is spontaneously generated by groups who have reached the same consensus, exhibiting collaborative behaviors of co-creation, co-construction, co-governance, and sharing. It is a byproduct after blockchain has resolved trust issues between individuals. You can understand DAO as an evolved form of the company as an organizational structure, but essentially, DAO is an organizational principle. 

DAOs allow us to work with like-minded folks around the globe without trusting a benevolent leader to manage the funds or operations. There is no CEO who can spend funds on a whim or CFO who can manipulate the books. Instead, blockchain-based rules baked into the code define how the organization works and how funds are spent.

They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice, and everything happens transparently on-chain.


# DAOs v.s Traditional companies



* DAOs are more transparent than traditional companies because anyone can view all actions and fund flows within a DAO.
* DAO operations are supported by blockchain technology and smart contracts, so services are automated in a decentralized manner, making them less prone to manipulation.
* Compared to traditional companies, DAO organizations are usually easier to globalize, and the barriers for members wishing to join are lower. 
* Token holders can vote on the development direction of the DAO or the establishment of various systems, and votes and results are automatically tallied without any intermediaries. In contrast, traditional companies are entirely decided by a centralized team, making it difficult to reach a consensus.


# How does DAO work?

The backbone of a DAO is its smart contract, which defines the rules of the organization and holds the group's treasury. Once the contract is live on Ethereum, no one can change the rules except by a vote. If anyone tries to do something that's not covered by the rules and logic in the code, it will fail. And because the treasury is defined by the smart contract too that means no one can spend the money without the group's approval either. This means that DAOs don't need a central authority. Instead, the group makes decisions collectively, and payments are automatically authorized when votes pass.


# RATS Protocol and DAO

In the Web3 industry, the needs and values of users, as well as the development and consensus of the community, are more important than market value and profits. RATS Protocol can truly develop its users only by developing DAOs and fundamentally binding the interests of DAOs. This means that developers rely entirely on the growth of the network and the appreciation of token value for returns, which aligns with Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision.

DAOs are the nurturers of projects, and RATS Protocol provides a perfect foundation for DAOs for several reasons:



* RATS Protocol is a Web3.0 full-chain infrastructure, capable of helping RATSDAO build a co-governance network and establish a project incubation platform for community developers. 
* Once a smart contract code is activated, it cannot be modified, not even by its owner. This allows RATSDAO to operate according to the rules used during programming.
* Smart contracts can send/receive funds. Without this, a trustworthy intermediary would be needed to manage group funds. 
* It has been proven that the RATSDAO community is more collaborative than competitive, quickly leading to best practices and support systems.
