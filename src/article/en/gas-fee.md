# What are gas fees?

In the context of RATS Protocol, gas fees are small charges incurred for the computational efforts required to process transactions on the RATS Relay Chain. These fees serve as a mechanism to fairly allocate network resources and discourage spam or malicious activities. Unlike typical blockchain platforms where gas fees are a standard feature, RATS Protocol only charges gas fees for cross-chain transactions processed on the RATS Relay Chain.


# What causes gas fees?

Gas fees are generated whenever a transaction is performed that involves transferring data or assets across different blockchain networks using RATS Protocol's RATS Relay Chain. 

The more complex the transaction, the higher the gas fees. Fees are also influenced by network congestion; during times of high activity, fees might go up. **Maintainers**, who are responsible for updating and maintaining Light-Clients on RATS Protocol, can earn extra rewards beyond these gas fees.


# How do I pay gas fees?

Payment for gas fees is made in RAON, the native token of the RATS Protocol on the RATS Relay Chain. When a user initiates a cross-chain transaction, the required gas fees are automatically calculated and subtracted from the user's RAON balance. 

Messenger, part of the RATS Omnichain Services (MOS), pre-pays these gas fees for the RATS Relay Chain as well as the destination chain. dApp developers have the flexibility to determine the fee structure for these cross-chain transactions through the Messenger SDK provided by RATS Protocol.


# How are gas fees calculated on RATS Protocol? 

The calculation of gas fees on RATS Protocol is based on several factors, including the type of transaction, the computational complexity involved, and the current state of network congestion. Unlike traditional single-chain models where gas fees are relatively straightforward, RATS Protocol deals with cross-chain transactions, adding an extra layer of complexity to gas fee calculations. Fees may also vary based on the reward model set up by Maintainers and dApp developers using the network.

By adhering to a cost-optimized revenue model, RATS Protocol aims to keep these fees as low as possible to encourage a thriving ecosystem around its Omnichain Services, including Vault & Data deployments for asset and data management.

In summary, gas fees on RATS Protocol are designed to be both efficient and flexible, allowing for a range of applications and services to operate seamlessly in a cross-chain environment while maintaining network integrity and security.
