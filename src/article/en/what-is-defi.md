Decentralized finance, commonly referred to as DeFi, is a type of finance established on blockchain technology. It provides financial tools without the dependence on centralized entities like brokers, exchanges, or banks, and leverages smart contracts on the blockchain (such as Ethereum) for financial operations.


# DeFi v.s Traditional Finance



* Centralized vs. Decentralized 

Traditional Finance: Operations depend on centralized financial institutions. 

DeFi: Runs on the blockchain, relying on smart contracts for automated execution, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries or centralized institutions.



* Transaction Speed and Cost 

Traditional Finance: Transaction processing is lengthy, especially for cross-border transactions, often with high transaction fees.

DeFi: Transactions are nearly instantaneous and more cost-effective.



* Accessibility and Inclusivity 

Traditional Finance: Usually requires identity verification and may be limited by geographical and economic backgrounds. 

DeFi: Theoretically offers services to any user with internet access worldwide, without the identity verification required in traditional banking systems.



* Security and Risks 

Traditional Finance: Protected by established regulatory and insurance mechanisms, but also susceptible to systemic risks. 

DeFi: While reducing intermediary risks, it faces the risks of smart contract vulnerabilities, operational errors, and regulatory uncertainties.


# How does DeFi work?

DeFi operates through smart contracts on the blockchain, automatically executing a variety of financial transactions and agreements, thus eliminating the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Users interact with the DeFi ecosystem through cryptocurrency wallets, engaging in lending, trading, investing, and other financial activities. DeFi also involves the tokenization of assets (like stablecoins), allowing the use of cryptocurrencies as a medium for transactions.

Furthermore, many DeFi platforms use Automated Market Maker (AMM) models to facilitate trading and enable token holders to participate in project decisions through on-chain governance.

The DeFi ecosystem, known for its composability, high transparency, and decentralization, provides users with a decentralized model of financial services.


# RATS Protocol and DeFi

RATS Protocol is perfect for DeFi for the following reasons.

By adopting Bitcoin-level peer-to-peer cross-chain technology, RATS Protocol enables asset and information transfer between different blockchains without relying on any third-party off-chain actors. This facilitates cross-chain operations in DeFi projects, increasing the liquidity of user assets and interoperability among DeFi projects across blockchains.

Integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) further optimizes light client technology, improving cross-chain verification efficiency and enhancing privacy protection and product experience for DeFi users.

As a bridge between different blockchains, RATS Protocol fosters the integration of diverse blockchain ecosystems, benefiting the expansion and ecosystem development of DeFi projects.


# Build DeFi

DeFi is an open-source movement. The DeFi protocols and applications are all open for you to inspect, fork, and innovate on. Because of this layered stack (they all share the same base blockchain and assets), protocols can be mixed and matched to unlock unique combo opportunities.
